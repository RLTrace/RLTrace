# RLTrace

Code snapshot for accompanying the manuscript "RLTrace: Synthesizing High-Quality System Call Traces for OS Fuzz Testing".  Our evaluation results can be reproduced from this snapshot. We will provide more documents and instructions to help reproducing the results during the ISSTA artifact evaluation submission.

```data``` contains coverage and crash information of RLTrace, Moonshine, and Syzkaller when fuzzing Linux v5.5 and Linux v4.17. Users can find description, logs and reports for each crash at ```workdir/crashes``` under each directory. All seeds used for fuzzing are located at ```XXX_5.5```, named as corpus.db. Users can unpack these database files using ```syz-db``` tool provided by Syzkaller to get all traces generated by RLTrace, Moonshine, and Syzkaller, respectively.
